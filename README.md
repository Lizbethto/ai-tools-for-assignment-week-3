# Power Learn Project – AI Assignment

This repository presents my submission for the Power Learn Project AI Module Assignment, showcasing both theoretical understanding and practical implementation across key domains of Artificial Intelligence. The work demonstrates proficiency in classical machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing, supported by ethical reflections on model fairness and bias.

The notebook begins with a classical machine learning task implemented using Scikit-learn, where a Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the Iris dataset to predict flower species. The process covers essential preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical labels, and evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

The second part focuses on deep learning using TensorFlow, applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to the MNIST Handwritten Digits dataset. The model is carefully structured with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers to achieve a test accuracy exceeding 95%. Model training, validation, and evaluation are documented clearly, and visualizations of predictions are provided to illustrate the model’s effectiveness.

The third section explores natural language processing with spaCy, analyzing text from Amazon product reviews. It performs named entity recognition (NER) to extract product and brand names, followed by a simple rule-based sentiment analysis that categorizes reviews as positive or negative. This task highlights practical NLP applications in sentiment monitoring and information extraction.

Beyond technical implementation, the notebook reflects on ethical concerns such as potential bias in datasets and model fairness. Tools like TensorFlow Fairness Indicators and spaCy’s rule-based systems are discussed as possible solutions to promote responsible AI development.

The code is thoroughly commented, ensuring readability and reproducibility for future learning or collaboration. All tasks were executed in Python, combining analytical clarity with practical design. The repository also includes a PDF report that documents theoretical answers, ethical reflections, and output screenshots for peer review and community submission.

Overall, this project demonstrates a well-rounded understanding of AI principles—ranging from classical machine learning to neural network development and NLP—alongside a commitment to ethical and transparent model design.
